        "**Ans:** The relative path is the path to some file with respect to your current working directory (PWD).  \n",
        "**For example:** if Absolute path to a file called stuff.txt is: `C:/users/admin/docs/stuff.txt` If my PWD is `C:/users/admin/` , then the relative path to `stuff.txt` would be: `docs/stuff.txt`       \n",
