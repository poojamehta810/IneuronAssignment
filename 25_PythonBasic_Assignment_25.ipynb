        "#### 2) What is the relationship between generators and iterators?\n",
        "**Ans:** An `iterator` is an object which contains a countable number of values and it is used to iterate over iterable objects like list, tuples, sets, etc. Iterators are implemented using a class. It follows lazy evaluation where the evaluation of the expression will be on hold and stored in the memory until the item is called specifically which helps us to avoid repeated evaluation. As lazy evaluation is implemented, it requires only 1 memory location to process the value and when we are using a large dataset then, wastage of RAM space will be reduced the need to load the entire dataset at the same time will not be there.For an iterator: `iter()` keyword is used to create an iterator containing an iterable object.`next()` \n",
        "keyword is used to call the next element in the iterable object.\n",
        "\n",
        "Similarly `Generators` are an another way of creating iterators in a simple way where it uses the keyword `yield` statement instead of `return` statement in a defined function.Generators are implemented using a function. Just as iterators, generators also follow `lazy evaluation`. Here, the yield function returns the data without affecting or exiting the function. It will return a sequence of data in an iterable format where we need to iterate over the sequence to use the data as they wonâ€™t store the entire sequence in the memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "iterators are objects that can be iterated on, and generators are special functions that leverage lazy evaluation. Implementing your own iterator means you must create an __iter__() and __next__() method, whereas a generator can be implemented using the yield keyword in a Python function or comprehension."
